# coding-events
The purpose of this app is to keep track of event information, specifically those relating to coding.

Currently, the app has functionality for recording types of events (conferences, meetups, social gatherings, and what-have-you), as well as
recording specific event data (Event names, contact information, locations, etc.).

Going forward, this app atill requires functionality for recording data on the people planning to attend the events. We need to place in a Person and 
PersonController classes and templates to track and present identifying information (names, ages, contact info, etc.).

2021-06-19: Addendum - Add links to event index that a) collect event details into their own page, and b) add & remove selected tags from event profiles.
